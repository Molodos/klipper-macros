# Klipper Macros

A collection of Klipper macros (mainly for the ELEGOO Neptune 4 series)

## Usage

For installation, the macro file contents need to be pasted into the `printer.cfg` and Klipper must be restarted afterwards.

> **Note 1:** Some macros have some additional definitions above them, make sure to also copy that. For example, the M300 macro needs the pin definition of the beeper pin that can be fount in the same file.

> **Note 2:** Some macros need each other. For example, in order to make the M600 macro fully work, one also needs to install the M300 macro.
